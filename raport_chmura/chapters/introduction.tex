\section{Introduction}

Formula Student is a student engineering competition in which participate over 800 teams from around the world. WUT Racing Team from Warsaw University of Technology has taken part in the competitions from six years. Two constructions has been built and now third construction is being designed. Conception of aerodynamic package is to generate as big down force as it is possible irrespective of drag forces. It makes sens because of low maximum speed during the competitions (it is max 90kmph). The down force increase friction between road and tires. Thanks for that the car rides faster in turns.

In this report will be presented OpenFoam's calculations of entire Formula Student car in comparison to Ansys Fluent's calculations on the same mesh.
